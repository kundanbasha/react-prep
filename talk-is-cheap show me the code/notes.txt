// talk is cheap, show me the code
1. Plan before start development. plan means explore about the project and design.
2. build wireframes of a project.
3. findout the components in components

4. what are props?
5. passing a props to component is nothing but passing argument to a function.
6. what is config-driven ui?
7. why do have to use a key while iterating a list? ref: https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html#recursing-on-children
8. never use index as key, why? ref: https://robinpokorny.com/blog/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern/

// Lets get hooked
1. Separate files for separate components --> best practice in industry
2. There is specific folder structure to follow, it's up to developers.
3. Never ever create hardcoded data inside component, keep it in separate file or folder.
4. Two types of exports, default export and named export.
5. Module can't have multiple default exports.
6. Can I use named export along with default export?
7. Hooks are nothing but normal js utility functions. eg: useState(), useEffect()
8. local state variable: scope of the variable is inside that component/funtion.
9. react will make the dom operations super fast and efficient.
10. in react Ui layer is synced with the data layer, when ever any change happens in the state variable, it will re-render the component.
11. what is reconciliation algorithm? it is also know as react-fiber.
12. react uses reconciliation algo.
13. what is virtual dom?
14. virtual dom is a representation of actual dom.
15. virtual dom is nothing but a normal js object.
16. what is diff algo?
17. react find out the difference bwtween two virtual doms using diff algo and update the dom.
18. what is react-fiber? ref: https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture
19. what react is so fast? because it is doing efficient dom manupulations.
20. useState returns an array. eg: const arr=useState();
21. whenever we trigger/call arr[1] react starts the diff algo and re-render the component;
